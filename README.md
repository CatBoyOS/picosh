# picosh
A low-quality terminal program written in python, for the Rasberry Pi Pico

#### Installation
Until this is confirmed to work on the pico, all code here is designed to run on any device with python 3 installed. Please keep in mind that I have only tested this with 3.9, if you run into any issues please submit a bug report.

1. download the latest verison from master
2. run `picosh.py` from a terminal using your prefered method

##### Roadmap
1. implement the rest of the path system and the rest of cbam
2. make sure this all works on a pico
3. potentially implement some bash-style functions (don't hold your breath)
